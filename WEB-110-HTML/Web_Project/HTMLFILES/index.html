        <p>I would recommend Sergio as a developer. I have worked with him for a few projects now and he always gets the job done on time and to my specifications. He is also always happy to help out with other general tech tasks that come up, which is really nice. Sergio is an amazing developer and I'm happy to work alongside him anytime!</p>

        <p>Sergio is the best developer I have ever met! He's quick and efficient at making changes that need to be made, always meets deadlines and has great suggestions for what could be improved. I have worked with many people in the field and Sergio really is a gem.</p>

        <p>I can't work with Sergio anymore because of his horrid code. We often end up with style bugs and he is constantly stopping to figure out what's going on when he could accurately detect the issues as soon as they arose. He also doesn't document his code at all which makes it impossible to understand what's going on and how to move forward.</p>

        <p>Working with Sergio has been a HORRIBLE experience. From the beginning he came across as arrogant and condescending. This churned my stomach, but we thought it would be worth it to get his help on our project. He was supposed to handle all of the backend coding, he messed up our entire analytics section before absconding without warning and leaving us scrambling to fix the mess.</p>

        <p>I have worked with Sergio a few times and have found that he is ok to work with. I can't rate him higher than ok because sometimes he makes careless mistakes and it will take him more time than some of the other programmers I know. That being said, sometimes Sergio will offer some really great insights in to what needs to be done, so that more than makes up for his downsides as a programmer.</p>
